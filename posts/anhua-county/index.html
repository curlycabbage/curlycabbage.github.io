        <h1>About Anhua County</h1>
        
        <p>Anhua (安化) is a mountainous county in Hunan Province, China. Historically, it has been relatively poor compared to the cities and coastal areas of China. Unlike other mountainous areas of the province, the inhabitants speak a variant of the Xiang dialect typical of lowland cities in Hunan.</p>

        <p>Anhua was once thickly forested with great, old-growth trees. In the late 50s most of the trees were cut down. The trees began to grow back in the late 80s, and now the mountains are well forested again.</p>

        <p>The villages and towns have changed considerably in the space of a generation. Once there were only a few roads connecting the major cities. Many villages were only accessible by foot. Since the mid 90s, many new roads have been built. What were once foot paths are now paved roads. Trips that used to take all day can now be made in few hours.</p>
