        <p>生于70、80（90初）年代的农村，那时候的我们，上学时候是很艰苦的！<br>
            For those of us born in villages during 70s, 80s and even early 90s, going to school was pretty arduous!
        </p>
        
        <p>那时家里孩子多，父母收入也不高，初中时候，家离学校远的，就寄读在学校，一周回去一次。像现在陪读啥的根本没有，能在赶集的时候捎带点吃的就挺好的了。<br>
            At that time, families had a lot of children, incomes were low, and middle school was far away. We boarded at school and came home once a week.</p>

            <img src="images/on-the-path.jpg" alt="on the way to school">
            <figcaption>那时的我们，每周去学校的时候，都会带上咸菜！是的，那回味无穷的咸菜！<br>
                At that time, when we went to school every week, we would take salted vegetables! Yes, the delicious pickled cabbage!</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>记得那时候，周日下午就要返校，临走前，母亲把腌好的萝卜从大缸里拿出来，洗洗切成丝，滴上一点油炒，再放上点儿辣椒，炒完了，给我装到罐头瓶里，我再塞满满一包馒头，接过几张零钱（一块的），这就是我一周的伙食。<br>
            Remember that time, Sunday afternoon will be back to school, before leaving, the mother put the marinated radish out from the big bowl, wash and cut wire, a drop of oil to fry, add some pepper, fried finished, I installed in a tin can, I stuffed with a full package Steamed Buns, took a few change (a), this is my meal a week.</p>

            <figcaption>当时蒸饭的场景<br>At the time of steaming scene</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>那时候，家离学校远的，就寄读在学校（基本上没有家长在学校外面租房陪读这一说），都是背一坨米，带一瓶咸菜，一般只有周末才回家一次，住学校的集体宿舍，日子叫一个艰苦！<br>
            At that time, my home is far from school, a boarding school is in the (basically no parents outside the school PeiDou rent this one), is back a meter, with a bottle of pickles, usually only on weekends home, live in the school dormitory, called a hard day!</p>
        <p>记得刚上初中那会儿，才开学时，有好多同学自己不会蒸饭，有的蒸饭不淘米，有的蒸饭不加水，有的把握不好水的多少。当时我们一间二十个平方左右的宿舍住了二十几个同学，热闹是很热闹，争吵打架被偷也是常事儿。<br>
            Just remember that the junior high school that time, after school, many students have their own not steaming, steaming rice and some don't, some rice without water, some do not grasp how much water. We had a twenty square meters of the dormitory twenty a few students are very lively, lively, fighting is the thing stolen.
        </p>

        <p><em>最难熬的是冬天，要用冷水淘米洗饭盒，太阳出来，手上的冻疮又痛又痒！<br>
            The most difficult thing is winter, it is necessary to wash rice boxes with cold water, the sun comes out, and the frostbite on your hands is painful and itchy!</em></p>

        </figure>
    
        <p>现在的孩子，好多是家长租房陪读；有些就算是住校，每顿都是在学校食堂买饭吃，根本没有自己蒸饭这一说法了。对于现在大多数城镇、城市的娃儿们来说，很多是不知道那种生活，也无法体会的。<br>
            Now the children, many parents PeiDou rent; some even live on campus, every meal is to buy food in the school canteen, no this is the own rice. For now, most of the towns, city guys, many do not know the kind of life, also can not understand.</p>

        <p>那时候，我们背上一大周的米，自己蒸饭，然后拌上自己带的咸菜，要是零花钱够点，那么就打一份汤，要是家里给得少，那么也是很舍不得打一份汤的。<br>
            At that time, we back a week meters, then mixed with their own rice, with pickles, if enough pocket money, then hit a soup, if the house for less, it is also very reluctant to make a soup.</p>

        <p><em>那时候日子过得是紧巴巴的，都是一天一天数着希望快点放周末，一般都是觉得过了星期三，那这一周就快了，然后回到家中，尝尝家里的土鸡蛋，加加餐。<br>
            When the day is tight, is a day a day of hope put on the weekend, are generally felt that this Wednesday, a week soon, and then returned home, home soil egg taste, simple meal.</em></p>
